<p>“VAX UP! Far Rock is a campaign Rise started about three months ago in partnership with the Dept of Health and Mental Hygiene. We’re doing outreach to the community to raise awareness about Covid-19 and vaccination on the Rockaway peninsula. The vaccination rates out here are very low, and Covid-19 infections are continuing to rise,” said Nirmala Singh, Program Manager of RISE.
</p>

<p>“When we were building out our outreach team, we tried to make our outreach groups as intersectional and racially diverse as possible. Different ethnicities, different languages; we’re trying to relate to the diverse community out here. People were much more receptive to that.”

<p>“Sometimes folks minds are made up. It’s not our job to convince people to get vaccinated–it’s our job to make sure they have the information to make those decisions themselves.”
</p>

<p>“Based on conversations that we’ve been having with different community members, many of the unvaccinated believe that they don’t need to be. They are saying that they had Covid so they built up certain antibodies, others are just against vaccinations as a whole. And then there is the issue of documentation. Some people in these neighborhoods with low vaccination rates are undocumented. One of the things we’re trying to do is get a van out to Far Rockaway that will provide vaccines and not require documentation, just to make sure that these vaccines are accessible to everyone in the community.”
